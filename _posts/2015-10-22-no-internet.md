## No phone - no problem

So I bought new phone in August - iPhone 6. I like it a lot. But sometimes in life one gets a lemon from time to time. So and I, after having it for two months, yesterday to be precise, my new phone's screen started acting strangely - flickering, doing actions on its own, not accepting my input and etc. What to do, what to do... So - I took it to warranty today.

What it's like to work and be without a phone? :)

It's OK. Yes, I lack it, but not that much. Yes, I grab some object accidentally and put it inside my pocket once leaving for a meeting or for a smoke be it keys for a car or a wallet - the things I have no need that moment. Yes, there's this strange thought in your head that now I will not be able to do this and that and some part of me wants to feel insecure... But the other part of me says, look man - you lived bigger part of your life without carrying phone with you, what can happen badly now? You're a grown up man! And after I understand that I DO remember my wife's phone number, I feel secure again and can enjoy more silent day without beeps and rings from my pocket.

Now go and do some javascript prototyping without the internet. Muahaha!
