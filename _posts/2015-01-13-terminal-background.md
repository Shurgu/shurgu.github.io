My daughter is again doing her trainings so I can spend some time doing my own programming tests. It figures it’s quite easy to use only one terminal to run your command line tools like jekyll serve or grunt watch. You just need to add & at the end of the line and the process will be run in the background. Same can be achieved via interrupting the process with Ctrl+Z and running it again in the background via command ‘bg’. To access background process there’s command ‘fg’.

Nice findings to improve my work ethics.
