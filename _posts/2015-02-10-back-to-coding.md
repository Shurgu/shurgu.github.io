## Back to coding

So here I am. UX Lab pod lead. Nice title but what does it give me apart from ability to reach my desired company wide frontend development goals? More responsibility? More headaches? No coding at all?

It appears that this change brought back love and ability to write some my personal code. Oh how I missed that! Let me make one more this years resolution - have a playable and hopefully addictive game by the end of the year. That is written in javascript and can be played across different devices. Adopt at last TDD approaches. I'll try to post updates of my experiments, work and different life stuff here... I hope...
