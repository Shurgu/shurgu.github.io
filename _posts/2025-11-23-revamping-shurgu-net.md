It's been a busy couple of days for **Shurgu.net**! I decided it was time to dust off the cobwebs and give this space a much-needed update. Here's a quick rundown of what we accomplished.

### 1. Fixing the Foundation
First things first, we had to get the site running locally. This meant:
*   Squashing a syntax error in the `404.html` page caused by some ancient IE7 CSS hacks.
*   Setting up the local development environment with **Jekyll** and **Grunt** to handle the build process.

### 2. A Visual Overhaul
The old design was feeling a bit... 2014. We decided to modernize it with a "premium" and dynamic look:
*   **Typography**: Switched to **Merriweather** for headings and **Inter** for body text to improve readability and style.
*   **Color Palette**: Moved to a clean **White & Indigo** theme (`#4F46E5`), replacing the old gray and red scheme.
*   **Layout**: Widened the main container and turned blog posts into interactive "cards" with smooth hover animations.
*   **Navigation**: Redesigned the top menu to be cleaner, larger, and more prominent.

### 3. Exploring Agentic Workflows with Google Antigravity
This entire revamp wasn't just about code; it was an experiment in **agentic workflows**. I've been working alongside **Google Antigravity**, an advanced AI coding agent, to execute these changes.

We moved beyond simple code completion to a collaborative partnership where the agent planned, implemented, and verified tasks autonomously. This project serves as a playground for me to learn and master these new workflows, pushing the boundaries of how we build software with AI.

It feels great to have the site fresh and running again. Stay tuned for more updates on my journey with agentic AI!
